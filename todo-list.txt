Next: TRY MERGING MULTIPLE BRANCHES FOR PRACTICE
-make enemies: (look into class hierarchy)
    -set appropriate starting position
    -respawn them when they go off screen?
    -ones that head towards the player
    -change player's size
    -erase enemies upon victory
    -adjust enemies' speeds appropriately
-sound effects
    --start
    --win
-implement death
    --draw screen
    --sound effect
-allow replaying (after win or loss)
-consider scaling everything, so it all looks the same on every device
    --look into eBook for discussion about this topic
    --since a dust speck is a pixel, could make number of specks
    depend on number of pixels, and then just scale the bitmaps
        --PROBLEM: all crafts move more slowly on bigger devices
            --could compensate by editing speed
            --could do what was done in eBook's Chapter 5

Eventually:
-make sure spacecrafts have correct size
-main menu background image
-delete activity_main.xml
-figure out why finish() doesn't work in the onKeyDown methods
-make some levels
-background music

Considerable:
-ways for the user to change his spacecraft's vertical speed
-change spacecraft's sprite depending on its horizontal direction
-giving the player the ability to shoot
-put finish line sprite at goal distance
-special effects when the user is almost at the goal; e.g.:
    -screen could have flashes of red
    -alarm sound effects could play
-implement explosion (via sprite sheet) when a spacecraft explodes
-combine all images into one sprite sheet
-design my own spacecrafts with either Inventor or Blender
