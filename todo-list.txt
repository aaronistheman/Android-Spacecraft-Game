Next:
-distance taken
    --winning the game by getting the distance
-make enemies: (look into class hierarchy)
    -change player's size
    -ones that go forward
    -ones that head towards the player
-implement death and continuing game
-consider scaling everything, so it all looks the same on every device
    --look into eBook for discussion about this topic
    --since a dust speck is a pixel, could make number of specks
    depend on number of pixels, and then just scale the bitmaps
        --PROBLEM: all crafts move more slowly on bigger devices
            --could compensate by editing speed
            --could do what was done in eBook's Chapter 5

Eventually:
-make sure spacecrafts have correct size
-main menu background image
-delete activity_main.xml
-figure out why finish() doesn't work in the onKeyDown methods
-make some levels

Considerable
-ways for the user to change his spacecraft's vertical speed
-change spacecraft's sprite depending on its horizontal direction
-giving the player the ability to shoot
-put finish line sprite at goal distance
