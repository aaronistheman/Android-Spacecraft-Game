Next:
-adjusting player's horizontal speed based on input
    --deal with max values (i.e. screen dimensions); constrain player

    -ones that head towards the player

Eventually:
-make sure spacecrafts have correct size
-main menu background image
-delete activity_main.xml

Considerable
-ways for the user to change his spacecraft's vertical speed
