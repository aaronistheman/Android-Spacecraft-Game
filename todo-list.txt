Next:
-adjusting player's horizontal speed based on input
    --control frame rate
    --figure out how to support two fingers of input better
        -look into having UI buttons below the plane (so, perhaps,
        SGView doesn't cover whole screen)
        -look into ACTION_MOVE in switch statement
-consider scaling everything, so it all looks the same on every device
    --since a dust speck is a pixel, could make number of specks
    depend on number of pixels, and then just scale the bitmaps
-calculate distance taken
-make enemies: (look into class hierarchy)
    -change player's size
    -ones that go forward
    -ones that head towards the player

Eventually:
-make sure spacecrafts have correct size
-main menu background image
-delete activity_main.xml
-figure out why finish() doesn't work in the onKeyDown methods

Considerable
-ways for the user to change his spacecraft's vertical speed
-change spacecraft's sprite depending on its horizontal direction
